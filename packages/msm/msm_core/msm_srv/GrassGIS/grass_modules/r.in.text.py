# PURPOSE:      Import a raster map based on an existing text file with the 
#               numerical data of each cell
#               The Hydrologic Disaster Forecasting and Response (HDFR) System is
#               developed for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) 
#               to provide estimates for identifying scour critical bridges in need of 
#               inspection. HDFR is a lightweight software framework that streamlines 
#               the process of automatically (1) acquiring real-time and near real-time 
#               observations and forecast data from numerous data sources/providers; 
#               and (2) translating them into concrete actionable information for field-team 
#               deployment. At present, HDFR includes precipitation data from rain gauges 
#               published by USGS and NOAA METAR system, NOAA NEXRAD radar precipitaiton 
#               data, NLDAS forcing data, NASA satellite data from TRMM, GPM, SMAP, and 
#               MODIS snow cover, SNODAS data, and NOAA model forecast data from GFS and 
#               NAM. HDFR integrates data and severity modules behind a unified GIS 
#               graphical user interface. The latter interface allows non-expert users to 
#               easily execute complex workflows. The data fusion module in HDFR is based 
#               on an extended multi-scale Kalman smoother-based (MKS-based) algorithm 
#               (Parada and Liang, 2004) to provide enhanced data products.
